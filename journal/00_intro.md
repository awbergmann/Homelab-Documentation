# Journal 00 -- Introductory Journal

+ **Date:** 2025-8-21
+ **Lab Phase:** Initial Setup

---

## Summary
This journal marks the beginning of my homelab project.
I've loosely self-hosted and tinkered with servers before but this is the first time I'm approaching it with structure and direction.
The purpose of this journal entry is to introduce the concept of a roadmap which will establush what i exactly want to do.

## Objectives
- Introduce the idea of a roadmap to guide development
- Define phases and measurable acomplishments to ensure progress
- Justify and make use of the hardware I've collected.


## Setup & Configuration
- Hardware/Software:
    + Dell PowerEdge R300
    + Dell Optiplex 3040
    + Raspberry Pi 4
    + NETGEAR 24-Port Gigabit Unmanaged Switch
    + x2 Unify AP-AC-Pro
    + Ubuntu Server
    + OPNsense
    + Ubiquity Controller

## The Roadmap Concept
A constraint of my homelab is that I cannot configure my current ISP-provided router/modem combo; Until later in the development of my homelab, my homelab will be designed to sit **behind** it. The PowerEdge R300 running OPNsense will serve as a transparent firewall and traffic manager in bridge mode. This is the extent of any planning until the next homelab journal.
